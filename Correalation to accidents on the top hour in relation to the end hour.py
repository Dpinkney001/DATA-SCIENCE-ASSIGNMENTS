Could it be the case that drivers racing to get somewhere by the top of the hour,
 drive more recklessly and get in more accidents, than those who are driving just
 past the hour? Using the birthday data set, display the number of collisions that
 occur on the your birthday binned by minute. The x-axis of your plot should be 
 the minutes from 0 to 59 (minutes after the hour), and the y-axis should be the
 number of the accidents that occur at each minute after the hour. Include in 
 your plot, a label containing the correlation, œÅ(minutes,# accidents). 

#4: Submit your Python program as a .py file.
#5: Submit a screen shot of the graphics window containing the plot.
#6: Do minutes after the hour correlation with more accidents in your birthday 
dataset? Justify your answer. Include a .txt or .pdf file with your answer. 

Hint: See Homework #3, #3-4.
